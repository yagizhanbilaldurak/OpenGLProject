# Interactive Windmill Simulation with OpenGL
This is a simple OpenGL project that simulates a windmill scene with interactive elements. You can control the wind speed and switch between day and night to see how the environment reacts in real-time.

The project was built using C++ and OpenGL as a way to practice animation, UI controls, and basic interaction logic.

The scene also features animated blades, moving clouds, and dynamic lighting to enhance the visual realism and user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1. Compile the project with any C++ IDE that supports OpenGL and GLUT.  
2. Use the **up and down arrow keys** to adjust the wind speed. This affects how fast the windmill blades and clouds move.  
3. Click the **button at the bottom-left** to toggle between **Day** and **Night** modes.  
4. Observe the changes in lighting, background, and object motion as you interact with the simulation.

You‚Äôre free to build on top of this project‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs adding sounds, more environmental effects, or extra controls.
